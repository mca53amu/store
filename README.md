Pricing plans help us monetize our API. Letâ€™s assume that we have the following plans for our API clients:

Free: 20 requests per hour per API client
Basic: 40 requests per hour per API client
Professional: 100 requests per hour per API client
Each API client gets a unique API key that they must send along with each request. This helps us identify the pricing plan linked with the API client.
